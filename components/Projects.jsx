                            FeederAce is a multi-device ecosystem comprising of both the FeederAce unit and the
                            FeederAce controller. The unit is used for controlling agricultural equipment through Bluetooth Low-Energy mode,
                            and is secure boot and flash encryption enabled, with signed OTA updates installable to the device
                            through the controller. The controller is a cross-platform Flutter application that connects to the
                            device and sends commands and updates to the unit.

                                Cowbell is a cross-flatform herd management tool built with Flutter. It utilizes Firebase as
                                a backend to perform secure authentication of users as well as act as a database to store
                                information needed for synchronization of data across devices. It also features a voice tool, which
                                leverages speech recognition as well as an LLM to process user queries to a serialized form to be
                                processed by the app. This allows for efficient and intuitive usage of app features.

                                Dualie is a 3DS homebrew library that serves as an abstraction from the native C libraries.
                                It utilizes OOP with RAII to take some of the complexity out of developing
                                3DS homebrew software, allowing those new to programming to start creating on the 3DS.

                                CMAT is a tool for performing Reduced Row Echelon Form on complex matrices on the Ti84-Plus
                                CE. Since the Ti84-Plus CE only supports real matrices and there is little to no third party
                                software addressing this problem, this software was created to implement a crucial feature to the
                                calculator in a simple user interface.
